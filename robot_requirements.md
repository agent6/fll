# FLL Team Robot Design and Build Requirements Document

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements and best practices for the design and construction of the robot for our FIRST LEGO League (FLL) team. The goal is to ensure that the robot is robust, efficient, modular, and reliable, while meeting the specific needs of the competition missions and strategy.

## Robot Design and Build Requirements

### 1. **Modular Design**
The robot shall be designed with modularity in mind to allow for easy upgrades, repairs, and adjustments during the competition:

- **Interchangeable Attachments**:
  - Design attachments that can be easily swapped between missions.
  - Use standardized connection points to ensure compatibility.

- **Mission-Specific Tools**:
  - Include tools and mechanisms specifically designed for key missions (e.g., arms, scoops, claws).
  - Ensure tools can perform tasks effectively without manual intervention.

- **Compact and Accessible Layout**:
  - Keep the robot compact to navigate tight spaces on the field.
  - Ensure that internal components (e.g., motors, sensors, wires) are easily accessible for maintenance.

---

### 2. **Structural Integrity**
The robot shall be built to withstand the rigors of the competition without frequent breakdowns:

- **Sturdy Construction**:
  - Use reinforced connections (e.g., double pins, beams) to reduce wobbling or breakage.
  - Avoid loose or weakly connected parts that could detach during matches.

- **Low Center of Gravity**:
  - Position heavy components (e.g., motors, hub) closer to the base to improve stability.
  - Minimize the risk of tipping over during sharp turns or uneven terrain.

- **Minimal Gaps**:
  - Reduce gaps between components to prevent snagging or entanglement with field elements.

---

### 3. **Efficient and Reliable Movement**
The robot’s drivetrain and movement systems shall be optimized for precision, speed, and repeatability:

- **Reliable Drivetrain**:
  - Use symmetrical and balanced motor placement to ensure even power distribution.
  - Test for consistent performance on straight paths and turns.

- **Traction and Wheel Selection**:
  - Use wheels that provide adequate traction on the competition mat.
  - Avoid wheels that slip or skid excessively during movement.

- **Power Efficiency**:
  - Minimize energy consumption to preserve battery life for multiple matches.
  - Use gearing to optimize torque and speed for specific tasks.

---

### 4. **Sensor Integration**
The robot shall incorporate sensors to improve accuracy and automation:

- **Essential Sensors**:
  - Include sensors such as the gyro sensor, color sensor, and distance sensor for enhanced precision.
  - Use multiple sensors for redundancy and improved reliability.

- **Sensor Placement**:
  - Position sensors to maximize their effectiveness (e.g., color sensor near the ground for line following).
  - Protect sensors from potential damage during matches.

- **Calibration**:
  - Ensure sensors are calibrated and tested before each match.
  - Include programming routines to reset and initialize sensors.

---

### 5. **Ease of Use**
The robot shall be designed for quick and easy setup, operation, and maintenance:

- **Quick Attachment Mechanisms**:
  - Use pins, clips, or other quick-release systems for rapid attachment changes.

- **Markings and Guides**:
  - Add markings to indicate alignment points for consistent attachment placement.
  - Include visual guides for aligning the robot at the base or start points.

- **Tool-Free Adjustments**:
  - Design the robot to allow for adjustments without requiring additional tools.

---

### 6. **Adaptability**
The robot shall be flexible to accommodate changes in strategy or unforeseen challenges:

- **Expandable Design**:
  - Include extra attachment points or slots for potential future tools.
  - Allow for easy modifications to the robot’s structure or layout.

- **Multi-Functionality**:
  - Design tools and mechanisms that can serve multiple purposes.

- **Field Testing**:
  - Regularly test the robot on the competition field to identify and address potential issues.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Team Collaboration**:
   - Involve all team members in the design and build process.
   - Use brainstorming and prototyping sessions to evaluate ideas.

2. **Documentation**:
   - Maintain a detailed build log to track changes and improvements.
   - Include diagrams and photos to document the robot’s design.

3. **Iterative Testing**:
   - Test the robot after every significant build update.
   - Simulate competition scenarios to evaluate performance under pressure.

4. **FLL Core Values**:
   - Ensure the design process reflects creativity, teamwork, and innovation.

## Summary
By following this requirements document, our FLL team will build a robot that is modular, sturdy, reliable, and adaptable. These guidelines will help us optimize performance, reduce downtime, and excel in the competition. The team is encouraged to review and refine these requirements as needed to align with evolving strategies and lessons learned.
