# FLL Team Robot Code Requirements Document

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements and best practices for the robot code developed by our FIRST LEGO League (FLL) team. The goal is to ensure that our code is modular, resilient, easy to read, and highly functional, while maximizing repeatability and effectiveness during the competition.

---

## Code Requirements

### 1. **Modular Design**
The code shall be broken into distinct and reusable sections to improve maintainability and scalability. Modular design elements include:

- **Constants Section**:
  - All hardware configurations (e.g., motor ports, wheel dimensions) and key parameters (e.g., speeds) shall be defined in a dedicated constants section.
  - Constants shall be used throughout the code to ensure consistency and facilitate quick updates.

- **Helper Functions**:
  - Common tasks (e.g., gyro-stabilized movement, turns) shall be encapsulated in reusable helper functions.
  - Helper functions shall include detailed docstrings explaining their purpose, parameters, and usage.

- **Mission-Specific Logic**:
  - Code for individual missions shall be encapsulated in separate functions.
  - Mission logic functions shall leverage helper functions and constants for consistency.

---

### 2. **Resilient and Repeatable Code**
The code shall incorporate features that make it robust and improve repeatability during matches:

- **Error Handling**:
  - Implement stall detection to handle motor or hardware issues gracefully.
  - Monitor sensor readings for anomalies (e.g., unexpected gyro angles) and take corrective action.

- **Repeatable Motion**:
  - Use trapezoidal motion profiles for smooth acceleration and deceleration, reducing mechanical stress and improving precision.
  - Incorporate gyro-based corrections to ensure consistent straight-line movement and accurate turns.

- **Reset and Initialization**:
  - Ensure sensors (e.g., gyro) are reset and calibrated at the start of each mission.
  - Use consistent starting positions and orientations for the robot.

---

### 3. **Readable and Understandable Code**
The code shall be structured and documented to ensure all team members can easily understand and contribute:

- **Clear Naming Conventions**:
  - Variables, functions, and constants shall have descriptive names (e.g., `gyro_stabilized_move_straight` rather than `move`).

- **Inline Comments**:
  - Key sections of the code shall include comments explaining their purpose.

- **Docstrings**:
  - All functions shall include detailed docstrings describing their inputs, outputs, and behavior.

- **Logical Structure**:
  - Code shall follow a logical flow, with distinct sections for initialization, helper functions, mission-specific logic, and testing.

---

### 4. **Useful and Functional Code**
The code shall directly support the team’s performance during the competition by providing useful features and functionality:

- **Flexibility**:
  - Helper functions shall include parameters for customization (e.g., speed, distance, angle).
  - Missions shall be easy to update based on changing strategies or requirements.

- **Testing and Debugging**:
  - Include a testing section to validate individual functions without running the entire program.
  - Provide debugging feedback through the hub’s light matrix or sound.

- **Mission Selection**:
  - The main program shall allow the team to select missions dynamically during matches.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Team Collaboration**:
   - All team members shall follow the same coding style and conventions.
   - Use version control (e.g., Git) to manage changes and collaborate effectively.

2. **Iterative Testing**:
   - Test each function individually before integrating it into the main program.
   - Use consistent test conditions to evaluate repeatability.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - Avoid redundant calculations or unnecessary loops to optimize performance.
   - Use sensor feedback to minimize wasted movements during missions.

4. **Alignment with FLL Core Values**:
   - Emphasize learning, teamwork, and innovation in the coding process.

## Summary
By adhering to this requirements document, our team will develop high-quality robot code that is modular, resilient, easy to read, and functional. These practices will enable us to maximize performance, repeatability, and adaptability during the competition. The team is encouraged to review and update this document as needed to reflect lessons learned and evolving strategies.
